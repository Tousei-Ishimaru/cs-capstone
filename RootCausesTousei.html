            <p style= "color: white;">Teenagers are anxious because they do not process their emotions. According to a Science Daily article, Putting Feelings Into Words Produces Therapeutic Effects In The Brain, "The study showed that while the amygdala was less active when an individual labeled the feeling, another region of the brain was more active: the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex”. This means that when feelings are labeled we use less of our amygdala and more of our prefrontal cortex. The article also states that “When you attach the word 'angry,' you see a decreased response in the amygdala…When you attach the name 'Harry,' you don't see the reduction in the amygdala response”. This means that not just any label will cause this reaction, but only the identification of the feelings, which causes the brain to process the feeling instead of assuming the feeling. Therefore, without processing emotions the amygdala will have higher activation, which leads to anxiety.

            Excessive technology use leads teenagers feeling anxious. According to a Bentley University news article, “Early research on multitasking shows that there is a decrease in performance”. This is referring to the decreased attention span caused by technology that leads to a decrease in productivity, which will cause stress and anxiety. The article also said that because of advanced technology, “We expect instantaneous results”, which leads to a decrease in patience. Having low patience will cause people to become stressed and anxious from day to day situations where results we seek are not instant. Therefore, excessive use of technology creates behavior problems that lead to stress and anxiety.
